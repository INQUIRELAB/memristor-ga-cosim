# memristor-ga-cosim
A physics-informed COMSOL–MATLAB co-simulation framework for optimizing oxide-based memristor (RRAM) devices using a genetic algorithm. The workflow couples a COMSOL electrothermal device model with MATLAB GA to systematically tune 13 design and operating parameters, targeting reduced forming voltage and improved memory contrast (HRS/LRS).
